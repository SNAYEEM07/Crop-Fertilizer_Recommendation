# Crop-Fertilizer_Recommendation
# Overview

The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based project designed to help farmers and agriculturalists select the most suitable crop for cultivation based on various soil and climatic conditions. The model utilizes the XGBoost algorithm to provide accurate recommendations.

# Features

Predicts the best crop to grow based on environmental factors.

Uses XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm.

Provides high accuracy and efficiency in crop recommendation.

User-friendly interface for input and output.

# Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing the following parameters:

Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) levels in the soil

Temperature (in Celsius)

Humidity (in %)

pH Level of the soil

Rainfall (in mm)

# Technology Stack

Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning Library: XGBoost

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Model Evaluation: Scikit-Learn

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

# Installation

**To run this project, follow these steps:**

**Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-recommendation-system.git

**Navigate to the project directory:**

cd crop-recommendation-system

**Install required dependencies:**

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the script:

python app.py

**Usage**

Input soil parameters (N, P, K, pH, etc.).

The model will analyze the input and suggest the most suitable crop.

The recommendation is based on historical agricultural data and machine learning predictions.

**Model Performance**

The XGBoost model achieves high accuracy due to its optimized boosting techniques.

Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score have been evaluated.

**Future Enhancements**

Deploy as a web-based application using Flask or Django.

Improve accuracy with additional features like soil type and crop yield history.

Develop a mobile-friendly application for easy access.
